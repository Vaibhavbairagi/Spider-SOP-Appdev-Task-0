Explanation:
        The egg comes firstâ€” when you narrow it down to chickens and the specific eggs from which they emerge. 
        At sme point, some almost-chicken creature produced an egg containing a bird whose genetic makeup, due to some small mutation, 
        was fully chicken.
        I think two birds that werent really chickens created a chicken egg and hence we have an answer: 
        the egg came first and then it hatched a chicken.
